Prerequisites:
-------------

1. This script will only work on *nix operating systems, such as BSD, FreeBSD, Linux or OSX
2. You must have the BEAST binaries available to your $PATH
3. Put the beast-analyser.sh script in /usr/local/bin (anywhere else and it probably won't work)
4. The script's name should be beast-analyser.sh and it should be executable by everyone:
	$ chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/beast-analyser.sh
5. Simply call the script by typing on the command line, in the directory where the BEAST output files are:
	# beast-analyser.sh
